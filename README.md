Notes:
1) In current version extension does not automatically configures your currency, preferred unit system and default language for translation, so you have to set it all up on your own after installation.
2) Currency rates get updated every 2 weeks, and at the moment of conversion data may not be 100% accurate. Currency conversion output is intended to be used only for a quick estimation.
